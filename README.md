# Godot_Bessel_functions_shader
 Implementation of Bessel functions using the Godot 4.x shading language.

# Notes on the implementation
I mainly translated methods of the GSL - GNU Scientific Library (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), into the Godot 4.x shading language.

They are simple nodes that aim at displaying the functions, and comparing them to generated values using the scipy package in python.
